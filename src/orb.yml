  An opinionated OPAM workbench for CircleCI.

  This orb supposes you are CI'ing a standard OCaml package
  with correct <package_name>.opam file in its root and
  a Dune build system (probably with a test suite).

  This orb was written to use official ocaml/opam docker images.

  MirageOS support is under construction.
